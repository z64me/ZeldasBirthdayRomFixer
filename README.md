# zworld-omit-unused-actors

This ad hoc utility was thrown together to quickly fix scene and room files from an ancient Zelda 64 mod titled Zelda's Birthday so it can be played on a wider variety of emulators, as well as on real Nintendo hardware. It works by recursively stepping through all actor layouts and deleting references to nonexistent overlay IDs, which are very error-prone.
